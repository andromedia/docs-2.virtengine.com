#Problem

* VPS - Hosting industry is stuck with poor choices lacking cloud features (or) unncessarily expensive & close-sourced platforms.

* I have lots of bare metal nodes, how do I transform that into an agile cloud `Cloud Booom!~ in a click!~` :+1: 

* Enterprises want an Azure/DigitalOcean/DockerCloud like experience in house (or) provide to my customers white labelled?

* Reduce Developer hours by Automating Application orchestration and scaling.

* Open framework/platform. No lock-in, & extendable.
