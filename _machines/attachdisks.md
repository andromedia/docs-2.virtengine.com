### Getting Started

Enter VirtEngine Console (UI - nilavu) by typing [https://localhost](https://localhost) in the browser.

Replace *localhost* with *your ip*

### Go to Dashboard

Click on the virtual machine that was just launched.

This will open the *management page*.

#### Click Disks tab

Choose `Attach Disk` and type the expandable size for your VM in MB.

Click Attach.

####  Disk Attached

[Connect to your VM](connecting) and verify if the disk was added.

Here we find that `vda` has `10GB` of storage expanded in the VM.
